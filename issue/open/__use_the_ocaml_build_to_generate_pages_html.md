# Use the oCaml build to generate pages html

Currently the perl script is used in the `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
workflow. We want to use the new and shiny oCaml implementation in the
workflow.

We need a way to download a specific version of the oCaml build and use it to
generate the issue html.
